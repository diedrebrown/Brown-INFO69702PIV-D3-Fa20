# Lab 4

## VERSION 1

This folder contains my submission for the D3-Lab4. These files include:

- The lab file (04_lab_brown.html)

- The dataset (gingerdogday.csv), which is a list of all the colors captured with Adobe Capture during a morning walk with my dog.

## UPDATE: VERSION 2

Inspired by the interactivity lectures, I wanted to see if elements of interactivity could be incorporated into a static visualization. Therefore, this folder now contains above, as well as:

- The new lab file (04_02_lab_brown.html)

- The datasets (gingerdogday4-am.csv, gingerdogday4-aft.csv, and gingerdogday4-pm.csv), which is a full list of colors captures with Adobe Capture in one day with my dog.

- A folder (captureimgs) with screenshots of all the Adobe Capture images.
