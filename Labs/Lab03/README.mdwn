# Lab 3

This folder contains my submission for the D3-Lab3. These files include:

* Images of the final product as it is (03_lab_brown-screenshot_01.jpg and 03_lab_brown-screenshot_01.jpg)

* The lab file (03_lab_brown.html)

* The dataset (phonepudata.csv), which is a list of the number of times I picked up my phone due during 26-28 August 2020. The dataset includes:

  * TIME - checking the time
  * NOTIFICATIONS - received a notification
  * ALARM - responding to a pre-set alarm/alert message
  * APPLICATIONS - using an application

Time was recorded in ranges of:

* <= 1 minute
* <= 5 minutes
* <= 15 minutes
* <= 30 minutes
* <= 45 minutes
* <= 1 hour

I elected to look at the number of notifications, as they have an annoying habit of leading to more phone use.

Though I was able to load my data and transform it so that the values were reading as dates and numbers, the final line chart would not show.
