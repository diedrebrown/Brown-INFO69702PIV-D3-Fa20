# Lab 3

This folder contains my submission for the D3-Lab3. These files include:

- Images of the final product as it is (03_lab_brown-screenshot_01.jpg and 03_lab_brown-screenshot_01.jpg)

- The svg test image I made (svg-phone.html)

- The lab file (03_lab_brown.html)

- The dataset (phonepudata.csv), which is a list of the number of times I picked up my phone due during 26-28 August 2020. The dataset includes:

  - TIME - checking the time
  - NOTIFICATIONS - received a notification
  - ALARM - responding to a pre-set alarm/alert message
  - APPLICATIONS - using an application

Time was recorded in ranges of:

- <= 1 minute
- <= 5 minutes
- <= 15 minutes
- <= 30 minutes
- <= 45 minutes
- <= 1 hour

I elected to look at the number of notifications, as they have an annoying habit of leading to more phone use.

Though I was able to load my data and transform it so that the values were reading as dates and numbers, the final line chart would not show.

Update 28 September 2020:

After realizing that my code was not functioning properly due to the old function calls formating, I decided to redo this assignment. Through the process, I also discovered that some of the issues I had with the svg not appearing were also related to an npm http-server issue on my machine, which caused the DevTools "ERR_UNKNOWN_URL_SCHEME" to appear. This error was related to false formatting that my VS Code text editor kept adding.

To gain practice with "creative svgs" I created re-did the assignment as an svg-data-display. I created a test svg image of a phone (svg-phone.html), then used this to create a data chart (03_02_lab_brown.html) seen below.

In the folder 03_02_lab_brown, you will find:

- The image of the final product (03_02_lab_brown_image.jpg)

- The revised data set (phonepudata2.csv), which includes a column that sums the total minutes I spent on my phone after picking it up.

- The lab file (03_02_lab_brown.html)
